Welcome to DoD Project CCM.
This project has nothing to do with the Department of Defense and is solely just a name.

For the best compatibility, please place the DoD_CCM folder in the base C: drive.

You can add items for the checklist by editing the PS1 file and you can add GPOs into their corresponding folders.

This is a tool that I made for setting up computers for work environments and for shortcuts in the windows operating system.

The following folders should be present to import GPOs from the script if cloning from git:
C:/DoD_CCM/Server2008
C:/DoD_CCM/Server2012
C:/DoD_CCM/Server2016
C:/DoD_CCM/Server2019
C:/DoD_CCM/Win7
C:/DoD_CCM/Win8
C:/DoD_CCM/Win10

The DoD_CCM.zip can be extracted in the base C:/ for near perfect compadability.
